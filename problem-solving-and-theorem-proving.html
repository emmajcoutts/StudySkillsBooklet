<p><em>One learns, and loves, mathematics by doing it,</em> not just by reading
it - Mathematics is not a spectator sport!
Therefore tackling exercises and problems is an essential part of
learning mathematics and by far the most efficient way of consolidating
and checking your understanding of the course. Books and notes should
always be studied with pen and paper to hand.</p>
<div id="using-worked-examples" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Using Worked Examples<a href="problem-solving-and-theorem-proving.html#using-worked-examples" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Worked examples will be part of your lectures and text books. Some
will be presented with the full written explanations however many will leave part (or all) of the working for you to complete; an example is presented in the Appendix which shows a partial and full solution.</p>
<p>When reading examples you should ensure you can follow each step by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working through line by line, filling in any gaps.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note of steps you do not understand so you can work on them
later. Ask a friend or tutor.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate the processes; your understanding; moments of
enlightenment.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Exercises<a href="problem-solving-and-theorem-proving.html#exercises" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Exercises are questions intended to train you to become skilled in the
straightforward application of techniques and/or to give you examples of
concepts which have been introduced in lectures. If possible, you should
try them before going to any class based on them, so that you can raise
your difficulties. It is hardly sensible to spend your time in the class
working through questions which you can do, only to find out later that
you have difficulties with some of the others. You should try to
complete all the exercises set, not just those which have to be handed
in.</p>
<p>Note that unless a specific numerical value is asked for it is normally
preferable to leave mathematical constants and functions, such as <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span>, in your answers. If you are asked to give your answers
to a prescribed degree of accuracy do so (and not to a greater degree as
given by your calculator or computer). For example writing
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)</span> is usually better than an approximation such as
<span class="math inline">\(0.866\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="problems" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Problems<a href="problem-solving-and-theorem-proving.html#problems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Problems (or more complicated examples) are not always straightforward: they usually require some
insight and creative use of the mathematics concerned. You may find that
you are unable to do them all and that some of them you cannot even
start! There is no recipe for solving problems but here are some of the
things you can try. The following sequence indicates
how you might go about tackling more involved problems/exercises.</p>
<p>Getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have lecture notes, relevant textbooks and calculator at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the entire question carefully and identify the key concepts
involved, (e.g. by comparison with the key word list from your
lecture notes).</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the mathematics likely to be involved and make sure that
you know and understand it. Re-read the relevant section of your
notes if necessary. Look for similar problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a picture if the problem allows it. In applied mathematics
diagrams are almost always essential, (e.g. to show the forces
acting on a body), but they can also be very helpful in other areas
of your work. Experiment with pictures, diagrams, patterns – they
often provide a real breakthrough. Make use of any software packages
which may be available to help you experiment more freely with
different diagrams. They can also help by, for example, solving
equations or evaluating integrals that you may not be familiar with.</p></li>
<li><p>If the problem is a general one, look at special cases or formulate
and solve a simpler problem first.</p></li>
<li><p>If the problem is abstract, look at concrete examples, (e.g. put
numbers in place of letters), take specific examples of sequences or
sets and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Think around the problem and write down your thoughts, (why not try
producing a ‘patterned note’ or ‘flow diagram’ of the problem?).
What you write down often gives you other ideas and helps to build
up a solution step-by-step. What you don’t write down often vanishes
into thin air and is not remembered at the vital moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and perhaps go up blind alleys.
Although the final solution should be logically ordered you may find
it helpful in developing it to work backwards from the result to be
obtained (if you are given it) as well as forward from the data of
the problem. Be prepared to gloss over details to start with in an
attempt to obtain the broad outline of a solution. You may be able
to fill in the details later.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are writing a ‘final’ solution, try to maintain good writing standards in both English and ‘maths’ by using sentences to explain your working and appropriate mathematical symbols to produce coherent arguments. (This will take time and practice.)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-you-get-stuck" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>What if you get stuck?<a href="problem-solving-and-theorem-proving.html#what-if-you-get-stuck" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>It may not feel like it, but getting stuck (and finding a way out) is the key to learning. Be prepared to struggle with the harder problems and to try different approaches until you find the way to the solution. If, after several attempts, you remain stuck ask for help.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Re-read the question and make sure that you know the mathematical
meaning of all the technical words and that you can give examples of
their use.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that key words like ‘deduce’, ‘hence’ and ‘otherwise’ often
suggest ways of doing problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a list of key concepts involved in the statement and re-read
the relevant theory.</p></li>
<li><p>See if you can do easier problems of the same type.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are still in difficulty then look for a fresh approach (e.g.
from textbooks containing similar examples).</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion with other students often produces new insight.
Explaining ideas to others will help to clarify your own thinking.
Don’t be afraid to share ideas; you will find that others
share your difficulties but each can contribute new ideas or
understandings. At the same time, try to develop your own thinking:
there is little value in simply copying someone else’s work and any work to be handed in for assessment should be your own, of course. If you feel you have reached a dead-end, then don’t give up – in the course of solving a problem new key concepts may appear and the suggestions above may need to be retraced.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get really stuck with a problem, don’t sit at it for too
long. Try something else, have a break, or sleep on it. <em>It is
important to know when to stop trying: and note your difficulties
for discussion at the next problems class or tutorial.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Do not be afraid to ask your tutor, lecturer or other relevant
member of staff for help.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="reflecting-on-your-work." class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Reflecting on your work.<a href="problem-solving-and-theorem-proving.html#reflecting-on-your-work." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you haven’t completed your work, hand in what you have done.
This will enable your lecturer to advise you on how best to proceed.
It is better to do this than to hand in a full answer copied from
another student.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to place the problem in context relative to the whole course;
look back at what you have done, check the arguments and look for
links between the result and the method with the rest of the course.</p></li>
<li><p>In writing out the final solution, pay careful attention to the logical flow of the argument. Read
it back to yourself to see that it makes sense. Check your working,
with numbers if possible. Keep the question and your solution filed
for future reference at revision time.</p></li>
<li><p>Handing in work is most important, you will recieve feedback which allows you to find out
whether your ideas are right, whether you’ve understood the problem
and whether your solutions are correct (even if the final answers
look right). You may have to do this anyway for continuously
assessed courses.</p></li>
<li><p>If model solutions are provided then make use
of them. Compare your solutions with those given. Sometimes you may
learn more from a model solution to a problem for which you have
found a correct solution than you will from solutions to problems
which have baffled you.</p></li>
<li><p>If in the course of attempting problems which are set you feel that
there are shortcomings in either your lecture notes or your
understanding, then make a note of these and bring them up at the
next tutorial. You may also find it helpful to attempt further
problems and exercises from relevant textbooks or to transcribe
worked examples.</p></li>
<li><p>If several of you experience considerable difficulties with a
certain part of your work, then approach your lecturers and tutors
collectively. If the problems persist then approach your
staff-student committee (perhaps through your class representative).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="problems-involving-proofs" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Problems involving Proofs<a href="problem-solving-and-theorem-proving.html#problems-involving-proofs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Understanding theorems and their proofs is often a source of difficulty.
When tackling a new theorem, <em>find out first of all what it says and how
it is used in the subject. Next try to identify the three or four main
steps in the proof to get a broad outline of how it works.</em></p>
<p>Two of the more difficult things in learning mathematics are the
construction of proofs and the appreciation of theorems. These are
inseparable from thinking mathematically. Practice and experience have
no substitutes but you will find the following useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use diagrams and pictures to explore the truth or falsity of
statements through appropriate illustrations.</p></li>
<li><p>Study lecture notes and set textbooks in order consciously to
identify the assumptions and the conclusions of theorems.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to locate when each assumption is used in a proof. It may help
to highlight such places in a particular colour. You can sometimes
appreciate why such an assumption is needed by investigating a
counter-example to the theorem in which the assumption does not
hold.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify definitions you need to know (find out what the definitions are if you are unsure).</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the notation used (and find out what it means if you don’t already)</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt proofs of ‘parallel’ theorems mentioned in lectures or left
as exercises in the lecture notes or in the set textbook. Look for
simple special cases. Familiarity with the simple makes the complex
easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Gain practice in the various methods of proof. Identify the ideas in
proofs and note their re-appearance.</p></li>

<p>Get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and key concepts/notation/words.</li>
<li>Use any similar, worked examples to help guide you.</li>
<li>Draw a picture (this can help clarify the problem).</li>
<li>Get stuck in and try different things; making mistakes is the only way to learn what works (and what doesn’t). You will get better at ‘spotting’ the way to go as you gain experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a short break, then re-read the question and ensure you understand each part.</li>
<li>Discuss with your peers.</li>
<li>Try a similar (perhaps slightly easier) problem.</li>
<li>Ask your tutor/lecturer for some advice.</li>
