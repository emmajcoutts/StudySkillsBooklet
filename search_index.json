[["acknowledgements.html", "Acknowledgements", " Study Skills for Undergraduate Mathematics Emma Coutts and Laurence Nicholas 2024 Acknowledgements This booklet was originally prepared by mathematics staff from various Higher Educational (HE) establishments in the UK, with revisions over many years. The objective is to help early stage undergraduate students develop study skills and good habits which will enhance their mathematical learning. This edition includes major revisions by Emma Coutts and Laurence Nicholas1. A list of some of the original contributors is given in the Appendix. Cover Image The image above shows a square circumscribed by a circle and each edge of the square is the diameter of another circle. The red arc shaped areas are called lunes and they have the same area as one quarter of the square at the centre. The equivalency of the areas can be shown, mathematically, in different ways for example; using integral calculus to calculate the area between curves or from a geometric argument. This pretty pattern illustrates that there are often different approaches to the same problem using different mathematical tools!

This booklet need not be read from cover to cover but a quick read through first will enable you to subsequently dip into it and read about the topic which currently interests or concerns you, whether it is making the best use of lectures, for example, tackling problems or revising for examinations. At the end of the booklet there is a list of books offering further helps together with appendices illustrating some of the points made in the text. Disclaimer This booklet provides generic advice and is not intended to be exhaustive. You should always adhere to the rules and regulations of your institute; seek institute specific advice from your department, personal tutor or other advice services available locally. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Figure 1.1: Two peers studying together. The aim of this booklet is to give hints and tips for the effective study of mathematics. It contains a lot of simple, straightforward advice which many students have found helpful in the past, although you may find that not everything here suits you. The suggestions are offered only as guidelines: some of them will work for you and others will not. This booklet is a general guide and your own institute will provide a bespoke induction to any new student; this will include essentials such as your log-on details, how to access course materials via the virtual learning environment (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle to name a few), your class timetable, personal tutor/mentor details, and how to find additional support from university services. It is important to find out how and where you work best and so time invested during your first term or semester in experimenting with study methods will pay off later. You will need to persevere with new approaches to learning, for example taking detailed notes during lectures and solving set problems on your own (or with peers). It will take time to find your best way of working, so be patient and stick with the task. The transition to university can be difficult. Not only are there inevitable and substantial changes in your social and personal circumstances - feelings of strangeness, loneliness and even euphoria are common - but you will also find dramatic changes in the teaching/ learning regime. At university, the pace of work is much greater and you need to be more self-motivate as you will spend less time in direct, personal contact with staff. You will still receive feedback on your academic performance predominantly via homework and tutorials. Remember that while you need to put in the hours required for your classes and the follow-up study, it is important to have a work-life balance. Join the sports club, the music group, the social club… Take time to be in nature, eat well, spend time with friends. It is a balancing act, but you need to look after yourself or you can’t get perform at your best and reach your academic goals. Although you will have to learn what is best for you, there is lots of support available - use it! You will have a mentor/personal tutor in your academic department who can advise on any academic matter (such as module choices) and will be able to direct you to the relevant support service for other matters such as disability services, financial services, study skills, health and wellbeing, careers service and more. Enjoy! "],["be-organised.html", "Chapter 2 Be Organised", " Chapter 2 Be Organised Figure 2.1: A sample of keeping time using an online calendar. Good habits and planning It is important that regular habits be established quickly and adhered to as far as possible. Naturally, different courses occupy different amounts of time, however these differences should not get out of proportion. Experiment and find out what times of the day suit you best for studying, given the constraints of your timetable and any other commitments. It can be helpful to enter your class schedule and other commitments such as work, societies/sports clubs into a calendar; digital calendars are useful so that you can access and update it easily from your phone (for example). The odd hours that occur during the day between lectures and tutorials are particularly valuable because they offer the opportunity of working in the environment where staff, other students, the computing lab and library facilities are available. A common problem is feeling overwhelmed by the vast amount of work that has to be done leading to a reluctance to get started. It may be worth ‘packaging’ your work into manageable amounts. Try spending a few minutes planning your proposed work before actually starting. A couple of minutes deciding on how much time you are going to spend studying (you might decide on no more than 30 - 60 minutes without a break in order to get started) and precisely what you are going to work at can make the prospect of starting much more palatable. It also helps to have a ‘special place’ for work that is physically comfortable yet free from distraction. As you work, try to get into the habit of asking yourself questions as this is a good way of keeping your interest alive and identifying areas where you are weak. Try to finish on a successful note, if possible, then maybe next time it will not be quite as hard to get started! Although many people find the pressure of a deadline for the completion of an assignment helpful to motivation and concentration, it is essential to allow yourself enough time so that the work you submit does you justice. For computing assignments the earlier you start the better; it often takes longer than you think to understand how to use a package or to write a working program. You might find it useful to take the syllabus and plan out what work should be covered, noting any deadlines, especially for coursework, in your calendar. The advantage of a digital calendar is that you can set reminders to help keep you on track. Keep in touch Keep in regular touch with your personal tutor/mentor, lecturers and tutors; this can be as simple as turning up to lectures and tutorials. Also talk with other students; do not underestimate how much you can learn from helping each other. By following through a proof or doing an exercise together you will have to explain your reasoning which strengthens your understanding, and listening to another’s explanation can help you to think of a problem from a different angle. ‘There is more than one way to skin a cat’ as they say and this is true of mathematics as there is often more than one way to solve a problem. Summary It will take a little time of experimenting but you will find your own rhythm and develop effective study methods - keep at it! Schedule your classes, social activities and work commitments in a calendar. Make note of deadlines for course work/homework and any class tests. Setting reminders in a digital calendar can help you keep on track. Find a space to work (your room, a study space in the library or computer lab…) where ever is most comfortable and accessible. Keep in touch by attending lectures, tutorials and arranging study time with peers; the gaps between classes can be particularly useful for informal peer support. "],["mathematics-as-a-language.html", "Chapter 3 Mathematics as a Language The Language of Mathematics Notations and conventions Summary", " Chapter 3 Mathematics as a Language Figure 3.1: A whiteboard with mathematical symbols. The Language of Mathematics Did you realise that Mathematics is a language? It has rules, structure and grammar. For example in the sentence “\\(x+1=2\\)”. the word “equals” is the verb, (it is denoted by the symbol “\\(=\\)”), “\\(x+1\\)” is the subject, “\\(2\\)” is the predicate. Symbols, such as “\\(=\\)”, are a shorthand for complex ideas (concepts) that have precise meanings. Symbols in themselves are abstractions, but their power lies in the fact that they can be manipulated to calculate solutions to problems. Getting to grips with these ideas is certainly not easy but it will be necessary if you are to be successful - reading and writing mathematics is as important as the calculations themselves. Being able to construct a proof that others can follow is a vital skill to demonstrate your understanding and convey your ideas. One way to get to grips with it is to read mathematics; starting with your lecture notes and suggested textbooks, you can ‘graduate’ to journal articles as you progress. If you feel yourself getting bogged down or stuck, slow down, try to identify the source of your confusion and if you still get nowhere ask a friend, tutor or lecturer. There are many excellent books that can help you learn this ‘language’ as well as the ‘mathematics’ it describes. We have chosen a few references at the end. Notations and conventions Get to know the meanings of any special symbols (such as \\(\\forall\\) \\(\\exists\\), \\(\\mbox{iff}\\), \\(\\sum\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ) including the Greek alphabet and how to say them. Try making your own list, or find a good reference sheet. Try to find out the different meanings of words such as ‘theorem’, ‘axiom’, ‘definition’, ‘proof’, ‘example’, ‘whenever’, ‘unless’, ‘if’, ‘only if’, ‘necessary’, ‘sufficient’, ‘for some’, ‘for any’, ‘for each’. The distinction between a general proof and a particular example is commonly misunderstood. Be aware that many words like ‘bound’, ‘limit’ and ‘infinity’ have technical meanings superficially similar to but actually quite different from common usage. Some of these symbols and their meanings are given in the Appendix. Summary Take time to learn common mathematical symbols. Learn the meaning of mathematical words and phrases. There are mathematcial dictionaries available and discuss with friends. Practice writing mathematics - it will get easier! "],["learning-mathematics-from-lectures-and-notes.html", "Chapter 4 Learning Mathematics from Lectures and Notes Note taking and note using In the lecture After the lecture Online learning Summary", " Chapter 4 Learning Mathematics from Lectures and Notes Figure 4.1: Baby holding mathematical textbook. This section is predominantly devoted to live, in-person lectures and how to get the most from them. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic, some lecturers/institutes use an online delivery method when it comes to core lectures. You will be made aware of the delivery method used for your course/modules at the start of the semester/term and full instructions will be available on how to attend lectures, whether in-person or online. We discuss the differences between the online and in-person methods in the ‘Online learning’ section below. Note taking and note using It is a common misconception that every detail of a lecture should be understood at the time when it is given – this is very rarely possible in mathematics. If possible you should try to follow the steps and understand what the lecturer is doing. The most important information about any lecture course will be the set of notes which you have obtained by attending it; you may also be given a digital copy but the exact form of ‘lecture notes’ will differ from course to course and lecturer to lecturer. In addition, you may have to make notes yourself from reading relevant textbooks. It is essential that these notes should be as clear as possible and arranged so that you can find information in them with ease. Acquiring the skill of making good lecture notes is essentially a matter of common-sense and practice; you must also make the effort yourself and be conscientious. Some of the suggestions given below may seem so obvious that they hardly need to be stated but it is amazing how easily they can be ignored or neglected. You should always: Arrive at the lecture in good time and with all of the necessary equipment. Some may like to make notes with pens, pencil and paper, while others may like to write on a tablet or annotate digital notes. However you like to take notes, it is useful to highlight important points and theorems. Sit in a position that allows you to see and hear well. At the outset you should be given a provisional course plan together with a list of recommended texts by your lecturer. If not then ask for them. During the course this plan will give you warning of the introduction of a new topic and it will help you to structure your revision. Number the pages of your notes; mark the place where each lecture starts with the date. Leave plenty of space so that you can annotate your notes easily when you are studying them afterwards. Use headings carefully to distinguish major from minor results, proofs from examples, theory from techniques. Make sure that your notes are accurate. You can waste a lot of time subsequently if, for example, you have written down an inequality the wrong way round or written \\(x\\) instead of \\(x^2\\), say. So take care and check with a friend if you are unsure. Your lecturer may use abbreviations or notations not found in textbooks so make sure you understand the meaning of these and what equivalents are more common. Your lecturer may make an error – everyone does from time to time. If you suspect this do something positive and active to correct it. Ask your friends what they think; approach the lecturer after the lecture; approach your tutor; or simply ask a question during the lecture. More often than not you will be helping everyone. Even if no mistake has been made the question will help you (and others) understand. In the lecture A constant problem in lectures is that you are required to listen to the lecturer, look at diagrams/graphs, read explanations and make your own notes, all at the same time! To do this successfully requires concentration and skill. What the lecturer is saying is heard only once; you do not have much time to decide what part of it to write down. A balance must be achieved between taking no notes of the spoken word and trying to make a word-for-word transcript, and the art of doing this must be mastered as quickly as possible. When you don’t understand the lecture, don’t panic; keep taking notes and seek help as soon as possible from the lecturer, your tutor and other students. Don’t be afraid to ask questions during or at the end of the lecture; usually other students don’t understand either and will admire your courage. Lecturers, like other human beings, make mistakes – sometimes ‘slips of the pen’ and sometimes mathematical errors – so do point these out as soon as you spot them! And remember that difficult ideas become easier to understand if you work at them through reading and doing problems. You should identify the style of lecturing. Here are some common types: Continuous written presentation without discussion This is a very formal style of lecturing which is sometimes still encountered. You should copy everything down and ensure your record is accurate. Don’t hesitate to ask the lecturer to slow down, to write more legibly or to re-display slides if you are having difficulty in keeping up. It is essential to re-read the material as soon as possible to consolidate it, since there will be no chance during the lecture. Written presentation punctuated by spoken discussion It is essential to be able to distinguish between the formal notes and the discussion – ask for clarification if necessary. Ensure accuracy etc. as for the case above. Summarise the discussion by making comments at appropriate places in the margin. Two stage lecture (Class discussion followed by formal lecture or vice-versa) Try to participate in the discussion even if you feel self-conscious or nervous; others certainly share these feelings. It is often not necessary to take notes during the discussion stage – listen and participate. Lecture supported by set books and/or duplicated notes Read the relevant section before going to the lecture. Make notes of any points causing trouble so that you can raise these difficulties during the lecture. Supplement notes with written comments from the lecturer. Above all, take your notes or books to the lecture for reference. Aim to make out a set of neatly laid out, coherent notes during the lecture. Some people prefer to make rough notes and re-write them afterwards but very few can sustain the effort required for this. In any case, the time after the lecture can be spent more profitably. After the lecture As soon as possible, work through your notes tidying up and expanding where necessary and checking the accuracy wherever there is any doubt (where, for instance, you may have copied something down in a rush). Try to learn any new definitions straightaway, make sure that you understand the details of any worked examples, pick out the important features of any new concepts and proofs. You may find it helpful to extract the key points, such as definitions, theorems, important examples or counter examples etc. and write them on your own ‘cheat sheet’ or summary page; this will prove invaluable when it comes to revision time. An alternative method is to highlight the key points in your notes. However you choose to do it, you should make sure that you make a good index and a brief summary for each set of notes. So, with pen and paper at hand, read your notes actively. This is different to the way you read a novel, for example, and involves you analysing and clarifying your notes - do you understand the important points, the steps of a proof (can you fill in the details?), can you replicate worked examples and apply your notes to tutorial/homework problems? Read your lecture notes, together with problem sheets, trying to sort material into order and into different categories; definitions, examples of definitions, techniques, minor theorems, major theorems, applications of theorems and techniques and finally, proofs of theorems. Look for examples both in your notes and in other sources (books, problem sheets, exam questions) and add these to your notes in the appropriate place. You could work together with other students in doing this. If you have been told to read part of a textbook, or handout, do so as soon as you can while the subject is still reasonably fresh in your mind. Make notes on what you read – doing this is rather like working over your lecture notes and picking up the ‘key points’. It is advisable to cross reference the material so that annotations in your lecture notes point to relevant parts of notes from books etc. and vice versa. If you are having difficulty with the lecture content or the reading which your own efforts and discussions with other students cannot resolve arrange to go to see your lecturer or tutor. Do this as soon as possible, otherwise you will fall behind and find yourself with several ill-understood lectures to sort out. It will be easier for your lecturer to help if you can be precise about your difficulty. Take your notes with you and be sure to have relevant places marked. If all of the above advice seems rather daunting and hopelessly time-consuming, don’t despair! Do what you can. You will find that you get quicker and better as time goes by - you will become a more efficient student. By following these ideas, you will acquire a record of each lecture course which can be referred to easily at any stage, is a clear account of the topic, and is an invaluable aid at revision time. Online learning We all hope the days of forced lockdown are over and we will not be returning to a fully online learning experience again! But some aspects of online learning have their benefits and have persisted. While most lecturers have moved back to lecturing in-person, in the styles described above, many have developed an hybrid method. A couple of different methods adopted are as follows: Flipped Classroom In this method the lecture material is presented asynchronously, in advance of the class meeting. This is usually via video recordings or other online materials. You are expected to engage with the online content; listen/watch/read, take notes and formulate questions on any topics which you did not understand. There may be examples which you are expected to try. In the live class the discussion is then led by the students (guided by the lecturer); it can involve individuals or small groups presenting examples/proofs/problems in front of the class or working in small groups. Online Live This method is very much like a traditional lecture (presented synchronously), but delivered online. The lecturer may share slides, or write live on the screen for students to follow. This may be in the ‘continuous presentation’ style or it could be punctuated by class discussion. The interactive portion of such lessons can be achieved in a variety of ways; a non-exhaustive selection includes: Polling, Breakout rooms, Use of the chat function, Or simply opportunity to ask questions. Summary It will take time to hone your note-taking skills, but you will get better and the more effort you put in at the start, the easier it will be as you progress. Be prepared with whatever materials you need for taking notes in your lectures (pen/pencil/paper/tablet/laptop). Try to keep your notes as neat as possible, and organise by dating the notes and numbering the pages. Consolidate your notes by going over them afterwards, clearing up any misunderstandings or working through relevant problems. Speak to your lecturer, tutor or friends to correct mistakes or clarify tricky sections. Finally, summarise your notes to allow for easier revision and access to key points/theorems/examples. "],["other-ways-of-learning.html", "Chapter 5 Other Ways of Learning Tutorials Problem Sessions/Workshops Maths Support Service Textbooks Coursework Library Summary", " Chapter 5 Other Ways of Learning Tutorials The teaching which supplements and supports lectures, varies from place to place, and sometimes from lecture course to lecture course, but often include tutorials. Considerable resources are put into tutorials because they are a very valuable part of the learning process. These may be discussions with your tutor individually or in small groups. The format will be determined by the tutor but whatever it is you can help to get the best out of it by attending to four points, namely: Make sure that you bring all relevant notes, paper, pen and calculator. If there is work to be done before the tutorial do attempt it seriously and take your work along with you, even if you haven’t got very far. Get involved! Don’t be afraid to raise your real problems however trivial they may seem, the chances are that others share them. If you are really shy about asking questions yourself try to form a group and appoint a spokesperson. Problem Sessions/Workshops Problem sessions are usually taken in larger groups than tutorials. Problems are worked on by students during the session and help is on hand to get you over difficulties. You will probably find it helpful to work with one or two other students in the group. The same comments as for tutorials apply. It is a good idea to attempt a range of problems of varying difficulty during the session so that you may gain full benefit from the help available. Since knowledge acquisition and skill in mathematics is a process which requires active involvement and sustained thought some institutions have developed courses that are investigation led rather than lecture led. Classes are broken down into small groups and they work on solving set problems either from a textbook or handouts. Then they all combine to pull together the themes that have been covered during the week. The idea is to encourage you the student to take more responsibility for your own learning but with the safety net that help is available when required. For such investigative learning courses it might be best to keep your own effort, individual or combined, in rough form until the strands are pulled together then they can be written up in a more formal and neat format. Our suggestions about tutorials also apply here. Such investigative work is also the basis of projects and research, so it is demanding and yet very rewarding. Maths Support Service Many institutes offer an independent maths support service which is available to complement your lectures and tutorials. Maths support is generally accepted to be the ‘catch-all’ name for extra-curricular maths and stats teaching which is provided in higher education institutions to enhance student learning. It is an additional resource which is not compulsory and does not bear any module credit. The exact format and mode of delivery will vary from place to place but is usually a combination of drop-in sessions, appointments, workshops and additional resources. You should find out how and when maths support runs at your institution and be sure to note the times; it can be a valuable resource and additional space to ask questions and clear up any uncertainty you have with your lecture notes and problem sheets. Textbooks These are often recommended by your lecturer or tutor either to supplement or to replace lecture notes. Many standard textbooks are now available as an e-book (usually via your library) but if you like to annotate the text, it may be useful to have your own copy - don’t forget to ask your lecturer about which editions are still applicable. The most important aspect of reading is to be clear in your own mind why you are reading: to get a rapid overview of the topic in order to see what is relevant or not; to search for a specific piece of information; to come to grips with and understand a particular theorem or proof! Each of these tasks requires a rather different reading strategy. Having a clear purpose in mind when reading is one of the most important study skills that you need to develop. Books vary widely in the notation they use and in their approach to a subject. During the early stages you should stick to books (if any) recommended by the lecturer and books which use similar conventions and notations. A ‘good’ book is one which suits you but you will probably want one with: lots of worked examples lots of exercises and problems answers at the back attractive presentation You cannot read a mathematical textbook like a novel – you will rarely want to read from cover to cover. Learn to use the contents page and the index to find the relevant sections and pages; sometimes you may have to skim through both to find where to look. Read slowly and carefully and always with pen and paper to hand to do supplementary working. Be prepared to go over an argument several times. If you have to gloss over a step, note it for later consideration. As always, try to understand the overall structure of an argument as well as the detailed steps. Make notes and cross reference them with your other notes on the subject. Always indicate on these notes the book from which they were taken together with the page numbers, so that you can find it again quickly if necessary. Problems in the text often have hints (and even answers) at the end of the book; these may help you with work on problem sheets. Definitions and notations differ slightly from one book to another and from lecture notes; sometimes these differences matter, sometimes they don’t – consult your tutor if in any doubt. There may be an index of symbols and notations to help you. Coursework Coursework has been designed to provide substantial back up to your learning. It can often help to reinforce material already covered and, equally, can often provide a firm foundation on which to build new ideas and techniques. The feedback given to you through coursework is invaluable, read it and make sure you understand it. As always, if you have doubts, ask your tutor or lecturer for clarification. Library Get to know your library well; it is the source of a vast amount of information. Go to any introductory talks and tours and obtain copies of any library guides which are available. Find out how to use the catalogue, find out where the maths books are stacked and spend some time browsing to see what is there. It will repay you in the long term. Occasionally browsing may unexpectedly help you to resolve a difficulty or clarify a muddle. Many textbooks are available online via your library catalogue, this can be a very useful way to access textbooks so find out how to use it. The library staff are there to help you – don’t be afraid to ask. There may be librarians with a special interest in and knowledge of mathematics books. Summary There are many additional ways to learn; use them! Be active in your participation in tutorials and workshops, it will help your understanding. Find out how to use any additional support such as Maths Support Services and Library services. You can find additional problems and examples in textbooks; start with the recommended text for your course. Be sure to read the feedback from any coursework; the comments and corrections are a valuable resource. "],["technology.html", "Chapter 6 Technology Finding Information on the internet Learning with Computer Packages Keep in Touch Equipment Summary", " Chapter 6 Technology Finding Information on the internet Perhaps the easiest way to find information quickly is to use the internet. Vast amounts of material are at your fingertips but be careful to fact check as you can’t believe everything you read online. Remember, it has little or no in-built quality control. If in doubt, seek advice from your tutor. One way of making sure you get to good information is to use a well established site or to check the information on several sites. Here are a few select examples (there are many more): https://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/ http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/ https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/mlsc/student-resources/helm-workbooks/ https://www.khanacademy.org/math Learning with Computer Packages Computers can help you learn Mathematics. Most computer laboratories have an extensive library of software available and most universities have software available to download for student-use on your personal device; your information/computer services department will have a list of what is available. There are numerous computer packages that are available; some you may need for a specific course and others which are generally useful tools. If a package is required for a course, your lecturer will make you aware of this and it will be available either opensource or through your institute’s computer services. Lengthy calculations can be eased by using Computer Algebra Systems; many of which can be used in an online format without download. You can combine algebra and graphs on the same screen to reinforce your understanding. They can also be useful in checking your answers to more routine calculations and procedures. However, be careful not to use these computer tools mindlessly. Make sure you understand the significance and validity of any solution you obtain. The computer is not a magic box! Examples with main uses are MAPLE Maths software, useful for many area of mathematics and statistics. Only needs simple computer syntax to enter expressions to get started. MATHEMATICA Similar to MAPLE. Extremely powerful but considerably harder to learn. Python Versatile, Opensource software with libraries for most mathematics and statistics applications. Requires syntax and knowledge of coding, however it is a good starting point for learning to code. MATLAB Relatively easy to learn, used extensively in engineering mathematics. Can do symbolic computations as well as implement code written in Matlab syntax. R Is an opensource software aimed at statistics and data analysis. MINITAB, SPSS, SAS These are general purpose statistical packages for the analysis of data. Powerful and easy to learn. Wolfram-Alpha This online computer algebra system is very powerful and excellent for checking long calculations. The use of AI via interfaces such as ChatGTP should be used with caution. Your institute will have a policy regarding its use and you should ensure you are aware of it. While this can be an excellent starting point, you should fact check any solution/answer given as a slight inaccuracy or ambiguity in your phrasing of the problem can lead to vastly different answers; all while sounding very convincing! Keep in Touch Your lecturers like to hear from you so don’t be afraid to go to them with questions. Use email to make an appointment. Equipment The only essential piece of equipment for a mathematics based degree is a scientific calculator. Most universities have rules about the type/capabilities of the calculator you use in an exam - check that your calculator meets the requirements. It is useful (though not a requirement) to have a laptop, tablet or surface since most notes and resources are made available online. These can be accessed via a mobile phone but it is advantageous to see the notes on a bigger screen. There are computers and printers available in labs around the university which can be used by students; they have most required software installed and you will have a print quota. Summary You will need a calculator, make sure it complies with university guidelines so that it is allowed in exams. Many maths/stats courses make use of software packages, not only is this necessary for some topics, it is an excellent transferrable skill if you learn to use them. Any required software packages will be available on university managed PCs and will often be available free, or at a significant discount via your computer services department.

Problems involving Proofs Summary", " Chapter 7 Problem Solving and Theorem Proving Figure 7.1: Geometric representation of Pythagoras Theorem, with semi circles and squares. One learns, and loves, mathematics by doing it, not just by reading it - Mathematics is not a spectator sport! Therefore tackling exercises and problems is an essential part of learning mathematics and by far the most efficient way of consolidating and checking your understanding of the course. Books and notes should always be studied with pen and paper to hand. Using Worked Examples Worked examples will be part of your lectures and text books. Some will be presented with the full written explanations however many will leave part (or all) of the working for you to complete; an example is presented in the Appendix which shows a partial and full solution. When reading examples you should ensure you can follow each step by: Working through line by line, filling in any gaps. Make a note of steps you do not understand so you can work on them later. Ask a friend or tutor. Annotate the processes; your understanding; moments of enlightenment. Exercises Exercises are questions intended to train you to become skilled in the straightforward application of techniques and/or to give you examples of concepts which have been introduced in lectures. If possible, you should try them before going to any class based on them, so that you can raise your difficulties. It is hardly sensible to spend your time in the class working through questions which you can do, only to find out later that you have difficulties with some of the others. You should try to complete all the exercises set, not just those which have to be handed in. Note that unless a specific numerical value is asked for it is normally preferable to leave mathematical constants and functions, such as \\(e\\), \\(\\ln\\) or \\(\\cos\\), in your answers. If you are asked to give your answers to a prescribed degree of accuracy do so (and not to a greater degree as given by your calculator or computer). For example writing \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) is usually better than an approximation such as \\(0.866\\). Problems Problems (or more complicated examples) are not always straightforward: they usually require some insight and creative use of the mathematics concerned. You may find that you are unable to do them all and that some of them you cannot even start! There is no recipe for solving problems but here are some of the things you can try. The following sequence indicates how you might go about tackling more involved problems/exercises. Getting started: Have lecture notes, relevant textbooks and calculator at hand. Read the entire question carefully and identify the key concepts involved, (e.g. by comparison with the key word list from your lecture notes). Identify the mathematics likely to be involved and make sure that you know and understand it. Re-read the relevant section of your notes if necessary. Look for similar problems. Draw a picture if the problem allows it. In applied mathematics diagrams are almost always essential, (e.g. to show the forces acting on a body), but they can also be very helpful in other areas of your work. Experiment with pictures, diagrams, patterns – they often provide a real breakthrough. Make use of any software packages which may be available to help you experiment more freely with different diagrams. They can also help by, for example, solving equations or evaluating integrals that you may not be familiar with. If the problem is a general one, look at special cases or formulate and solve a simpler problem first. If the problem is abstract, look at concrete examples, (e.g. put numbers in place of letters), take specific examples of sequences or sets and so on. Think around the problem and write down your thoughts, (why not try producing a ‘patterned note’ or ‘flow diagram’ of the problem?). What you write down often gives you other ideas and helps to build up a solution step-by-step. What you don’t write down often vanishes into thin air and is not remembered at the vital moment. Don’t be afraid to experiment and perhaps go up blind alleys. Although the final solution should be logically ordered you may find it helpful in developing it to work backwards from the result to be obtained (if you are given it) as well as forward from the data of the problem. Be prepared to gloss over details to start with in an attempt to obtain the broad outline of a solution. You may be able to fill in the details later. When you are writing a ‘final’ solution, try to maintain good writing standards in both English and ‘maths’ by using sentences to explain your working and appropriate mathematical symbols to produce coherent arguments. (This will take time and practice.) What if you get stuck? It may not feel like it, but getting stuck (and finding a way out) is the key to learning. Be prepared to struggle with the harder problems and to try different approaches until you find the way to the solution. If, after several attempts, you remain stuck ask for help. Re-read the question and make sure that you know the mathematical meaning of all the technical words and that you can give examples of their use. Notice that key words like ‘deduce’, ‘hence’ and ‘otherwise’ often suggest ways of doing problems. Make a list of key concepts involved in the statement and re-read the relevant theory. See if you can do easier problems of the same type. If you are still in difficulty then look for a fresh approach (e.g. from textbooks containing similar examples). Discussion with other students often produces new insight. Explaining ideas to others will help to clarify your own thinking. Don’t be afraid to share ideas; you will find that others share your difficulties but each can contribute new ideas or understandings. At the same time, try to develop your own thinking: there is little value in simply copying someone else’s work and any work to be handed in for assessment should be your own, of course. If you feel you have reached a dead-end, then don’t give up – in the course of solving a problem new key concepts may appear and the suggestions above may need to be retraced. If you get really stuck with a problem, don’t sit at it for too long. Try something else, have a break, or sleep on it. It is important to know when to stop trying: and note your difficulties for discussion at the next problems class or tutorial. Do not be afraid to ask your tutor, lecturer or other relevant member of staff for help. Reflecting on your work. Even if you haven’t completed your work, hand in what you have done. This will enable your lecturer to advise you on how best to proceed. It is better to do this than to hand in a full answer copied from another student. Try to place the problem in context relative to the whole course; look back at what you have done, check the arguments and look for links between the result and the method with the rest of the course. In writing out the final solution, pay careful attention to the logical flow of the argument. Read it back to yourself to see that it makes sense. Check your working, with numbers if possible. Keep the question and your solution filed for future reference at revision time. Handing in work is most important, you will recieve feedback which allows you to find out whether your ideas are right, whether you’ve understood the problem and whether your solutions are correct (even if the final answers look right). You may have to do this anyway for continuously assessed courses. If model solutions are provided then make use of them. Compare your solutions with those given. Sometimes you may learn more from a model solution to a problem for which you have found a correct solution than you will from solutions to problems which have baffled you. If in the course of attempting problems which are set you feel that there are shortcomings in either your lecture notes or your understanding, then make a note of these and bring them up at the next tutorial. You may also find it helpful to attempt further problems and exercises from relevant textbooks or to transcribe worked examples. If several of you experience considerable difficulties with a certain part of your work, then approach your lecturers and tutors collectively. If the problems persist then approach your staff-student committee (perhaps through your class representative). Problems involving Proofs Understanding theorems and their proofs is often a source of difficulty. When tackling a new theorem, find out first of all what it says and how it is used in the subject. Next try to identify the three or four main steps in the proof to get a broad outline of how it works. Two of the more difficult things in learning mathematics are the construction of proofs and the appreciation of theorems. These are inseparable from thinking mathematically. Practice and experience have no substitutes but you will find the following useful: Use diagrams and pictures to explore the truth or falsity of statements through appropriate illustrations. Study lecture notes and set textbooks in order consciously to identify the assumptions and the conclusions of theorems. Try to locate when each assumption is used in a proof. It may help to highlight such places in a particular colour. You can sometimes appreciate why such an assumption is needed by investigating a counter-example to the theorem in which the assumption does not hold. Identify definitions you need to know (find out what the definitions are if you are unsure). Identify the notation used (and find out what it means if you don’t already) Attempt proofs of ‘parallel’ theorems mentioned in lectures or left as exercises in the lecture notes or in the set textbook. Look for simple special cases. Familiarity with the simple makes the complex easier. Gain practice in the various methods of proof. Identify the ideas in proofs and note their re-appearance. Summary Get started: Identify and key concepts/notation/words. Use any similar, worked examples to help guide you. Draw a picture (this can help clarify the problem). Get stuck in and try different things; making mistakes is the only way to learn what works (and what doesn’t). You will get better at ‘spotting’ the way to go as you gain experience. If you get stuck: Take a short break, then re-read the question and ensure you understand each part. Discuss with your peers. Try a similar (perhaps slightly easier) problem. Ask your tutor/lecturer for some advice. "],["continuous-assessment-coursework-and-projects.html", "Chapter 8 Continuous Assessment, Coursework and Projects Getting started Getting on Getting finished Presentations Summary", " Chapter 8 Continuous Assessment, Coursework and Projects Figure 8.1: Peers working together. Within the general information given for each course/module you take there will be information regarding the mode of assessment; certain courses may be continuously assessed. What will that mean? Assessment which is carried out throughout the life of a course or module and is made up of coursework is known as continual or continuous assessment (CA). It can mean anything from a mid-session test worth only a few marks (plus a final exam making up the rest) to having weekly tests worth a total of 100% and no final exam at all. Often it is something between these two extremes. CA is used to monitor your progress and, through feedback to enhance teaching. If there is to be frequent testing then clearly the sort of revision appropriate for an examination will not be possible. However, it makes sense to be as up to date with your work as is practicable. Where testing by computer is involved try to practice on similar examples to that of the test so that it will not be too strange. If it is a computer based course then ask for help if stuck and use any free lab sessions to complete your assignments. (But don’t let the computing completely take over). Mid-session tests may be like having an extended tutorial problem (and may also be ‘open-book’) so seek early guidance on the format and marks allocation. You will need to do revision for these in the way we have outlined in the section on Revision Techniques. Course work assignments typically involve an extended piece of work, 1-2 weeks duration, and can involve anything from using a computer package to writing an essay or solving longer problems. Projects on the other hand usually involve work over a whole session or module and are like extended investigations; they may be individual or group projects. You will be required to produce a report and you may have to make a short presentation of what you have done. These are transferable skills that will be invaluable in the work-place and so are well worth acquiring. Getting started Each assignment will have a deadline. It may seem a long way off, but it isn’t. The sooner you start the more time you’ll have to think things out. Try to note all deadlines in your calendar (set reminders) so that you can plan your work; this is particularly valuable if two deadlines are close to one another. Getting on There is no better way of developing ideas than by talking to others. That doesn’t mean getting them to do the work. Discussion stimulates your mind. Getting people to do the work for you is cheating. Make good use of any materials which your tutor recommends or relevant materials you find for yourself. Books, computer software and suchlike can give you ideas. Make a careful note of any references for inclusion in a bibliography at the end of your work. Resist the temptation to cut and paste material from the internet into your work without carefully acknowledging the source. This is cheating and easy for staff to spot. Using AI such as ChatGTP can also be problematic if you simply cut and paste the answers - if your question is not posed correctly, you may not be getting the full (or indeed, correct) answer. While it is a useful tool to find definitions and clarify points, using it to answer your questions is clearly not your own work! Don’t overdo it. Coursework and projects can take over. Decide how much time you are going to allow yourself to finish and don’t exceed it, otherwise other courses will suffer. Getting finished The sooner you finish the better. If it is necessary to change things at the last moment there will then be time. If the deadline is creeping up on you, you will become increasingly worried. Remember that for computer programming projects in particular, it is essential that your program works. Don’t leave it until the last moment to try; debugging code can be frustrating and time-consuming. The presentation of your report is very important. Submitted solutions need to be complete, with good grammar and logical reasoning and an explanation of the processes you’ve used. You may have found an answer using a “back of the envelope” but for submission this will need to be written out in full, see the Appendix. Presentations Here is your opportunity to explain the aim of your project and what you have done. Practice your delivery (and practice again), keep your slides simple and pace what you have to say. Seek out any help that may be on offer on student presentations. e.g. from study skills advisors/skills hub. Summary Ensure you know your deadlines and get started on the work early. If you are stuck, seek help from your tutor/lecturer. Use relevant services available to you eg library, study skills. Take time to present your work in a suitable format; ensure written work is neat, clearly written, and logical. For presentations, keep slides simple and practice to ensure you are prepared and know your pace. "],["revision-techniques-and-what-to-expect-in-an-exam.html", "Chapter 9 Revision Techniques and What to Expect in an Exam General Advice A planned strategy Active revision with other students What to Expect in an Exam (and how to prepare) Summary", " Chapter 9 Revision Techniques and What to Expect in an Exam General Advice Like it or not, one of your main preoccupations will be with exams. Time spent in determining the demands of the exam period and orientating your work with these demands in mind is time well spent. Attend your lectures, listen to what is said about exam papers and talk about common problems with other students. One dictionary defines ‘revision’ as “renewed study with a view to refreshing and repairing gaps in the memory\". It is not a substitute for steady, hard work whilst courses are in progress but it is the last stage of the work which has been built on throughout the whole term/semester. The revision period before exams is a time for re-familiarising yourself with ideas which may have been crowded out by more recent work, rather than trying to understand new work. As with every other aspect of study, you must find out what suits you personally but you may find some of the following advice useful. Ideally, the process of revision begins when you first meet the material in lectures; the longer you spend getting to know it, the easier it is in the weeks before exams. Decide, with your tutor’s help if necessary, what formulae and proofs you need to memorise and what can be worked out on the spot; find out if there will be a formula sheet in the exam and what it contains. Memorising should not be parrot fashion but by familiarity through regular use. A useful device for consolidating the lecture course is the preparation of patterned or ‘skeleton’ notes, compiled perhaps from the list of key areas and words, with some indication of their inter-relationships. You should also ascertain the format of the individual exam papers from the lecturer and the topics to be assessed. Revise these areas efficiently, e.g. by means of your skeleton notes. It is important to practice questions, from tutorials/workshops, to consolidate your knowledge. Practice of exam style questions, from past-papers, not only helps consolidate knowledge but allows you to practice time-keeping which is vital in a traditional timed-exam setting. A planned strategy Work out a strategy and plan your campaign, for example: Mathematics is best revised, as well as learned, by doing it, in particular, by solving problems. Use old exam papers (but check for syllabus changes) for ‘dummy runs’; practice doing exam questions under self-imposed exam conditions. Ask the lecturer to hand out revision sheets of problems of the type that may appear in your exam. This is especially important if there are few, or no, past papers or if there has been a change in the course lecturer or syllabus. Writing things down again, such as basic theorems and results, will simulate what may be required of you in an examination and will aid your memory of them. Prepare a clear plan for your revision and try to stick to it. Make a list of aims for each revision session and don’t get side-tracked. You will probably find it helpful to divide each set of notes into topics, perhaps based on past papers or lecture headings, and to revise one topic at a time. However you should also try to get an overall view of the course and look for links between topics. When revising one topic you may want to work through a number of past exam questions on that topic. In doing so you may also encounter difficulties on a quite different topic, since exam questions are often not based on a single topic. Make notes of any such difficulties and come back to them later rather than amend your revision plan. Use your revision to practice examination technique too. Get into the habit of reading each question carefully, and analysing its component parts so that you know exactly what is required in the answer. Write your solutions neatly, clearly and concisely. The speed of writing is not so important in mathematics as in essay-based subjects: clarity of thought and economy of expression are what matter. Try a few questions within the time limit which would be allowed for them in the exam. After the time allowed for the question is up, stop and assess what you have done and how it might be improved. You will probably be rather slow at first but as you practice doing questions on a given topic you will speed up. Some students find it helpful to keep one past paper for final run-through under exam conditions. Difficulties which you encounter when trying to do problems and exam questions will force you back to your lecture notes for information on the topic you are revising. This is the right way to get into your notes – you will get no where if you simply sit down and try to read them through from the beginning with the idea that you will try some problems when you have mastered the notes! Remember that you have not achieved mastery of a particular point until you can reproduce proofs etc. with understanding and without reference to your notes, and solve straightforward exercises quickly and with ease. Try to make sure that you really do understand and are able to use the things you think you know. You should aim to be able to do the standard book work and routine parts of questions efficiently and without too much effort. If you have difficulty in trying to cover the entire range of a course, concentrate on a smaller number of topics and revise them thoroughly. Give priority to those topics which appear frequently in past papers and those you feel most at home with. Remember that you are (probably!) not aiming at 100%. Every revision plan should pay special attention to the basic mathematical techniques of the course, especially those which have been used frequently and those from earlier courses which keep cropping up. When going through your notes, homework sheets and past problems on a course, make a list of the points you do not understand and the problems you cannot do. Arrange to see the appropriate lecturer or tutor to go through your difficulties. Bear in mind that everyone else may be doing the same, so you will need to make a proper appointment and try to identify your difficulties as precisely as you can to make the best use of the time that can be given to you. Don’t use this as a substitute for sorting out difficulties earlier in the year immediately after the lecture in which they arose. Work hard, but sensibly – don’t overdo it. Make sure you get adequate relaxation, exercise and sleep. For many students it is probably best to avoid working right up to the exam itself; otherwise you may cause your mind to become confused and actually impair your performance in the exam. Some can benefit from looking up theorems, definitions, formulae etc. at the last moment but others may do better by taking a complete break for the last few hours. The important thing is to know yourself and what works for you. Active revision with other students There are enormous benefits to be gained by working with your fellow students, solving problems together and helping with each other’s difficulties. Your fellow students should be a great help to you and you to them. Here are two examples of how you could work with friends to ‘sort out’ past exam papers and to get to know what is required (i.e. to learn how to play the system). Take a set of past exam papers and write each question on an index card. On the other side note down the content areas or topic of the question, the nature of the question (e.g. define, prove, calculate) and try to analyse a little further what each question demands (e.g. recall of standard ‘bookwork’ critical evaluation, problem solving). Sort the cards to establish the frequency of different topics and different types of questions. Compare your classifications with those of fellow students and even tutors. Learn from each other the nature of exam questions in your course. Pick an exam paper and make systematic notes on how you would answer one of the questions. Compare your notes with those of other students doing the same exercise. Work out together what would make a good answer. Then write a complete answer and swap these around for marking. Try to discuss systematically why different attempts are differently valued. What to Expect in an Exam (and how to prepare) In this small section we provide a brief overview of what to expect from (and how to prepare for) the exam. Prior to the exam Prior to the exam period, the university will publish an exam timetable which will list the exam dates, times and locations. Be sure to check where and when all your exams are scheduled; add them to your calendar and set reminders. Nothing will replace good preparation so follow our tips in the first part of this chapter. Pack your supplies for the exam the night before. You will need pens, a calculator and your student ID. (You may wish to have some snacks and water too). Set your alarm and have a good night’s sleep! Eat breakfast, a 2 to 3 hour exam requires stamina! In the exam Arrive in good time, now is the time to use the bathroom. When you enter the hall/room find your seat and set out your supplies. When time starts, fill in the exam booklet as per the instructions. You may also wish to jot down any formulae on the booklet so that you can refer to them as the exam goes on. Read the instructions at the start of the paper; do you need to answer all questions or only (for example) 4 out of 5. Read through the whole paper, making a mental note of the type of question and topic covered - which do you prefer? Start with your comfortable topics, you do not need to answer in order. But do make sure you clearly mark the question number in the margin. After attempting all questions, go back and check your answers. Double check ‘simple’ calculations, it is easy to make a mistake under pressure. You can do rough work but ensure to write your final answer clearly and logically and score out any incorrect workings. You can ask for more paper if needed. If you genuinely feel there is a mistake in the paper, raise your hand and ask the invigilator. They are there to help you. What if you get stuck? Take a deep breath and stay calm. Re-read the question. Jot down some ideas/related formulae this can help you recall the next step. Try to work backwards; working from the end can help you see connections. Make sure you write the solution out in the correct order before you finish. If you are still stuck, move on. You can come back to the question but you cannot get back lost time. After the Exam Forget about it; prepare for the next paper if there is one, or relax if you are finished! Summary Revision: Prepare a revision plan and do your best to stick to it. Cover the whole course, working through problems, tutorials and referring to notes. Practice the past-paper questions. Keep some of the questions to do under ‘exam conditions’ and timings. Seek help from tutors/lecturers when you come across an issue. Make an appointment, take your notes and have a clear idea of what you want to ask them. Work with friends, draft solutions together and test each other’s knowledge of key points from the course. In the exam: Ensure you know where and when your exam is and pack the supplies you will need the night before. Read all the questions before you start to answer and start with a topic you are comfortable with. If you get stuck do not panic, move onto another question and come back to it later. "],["appendix.html", "Appendix A worked example Common mathematical symbols Contributors Books", " Appendix A worked example The following examples A and B are solutions to the same question.
